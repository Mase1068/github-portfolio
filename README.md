I learned how to write Google Cloud from My Order company, 
and also had the opportunity to try using the Cloud Shell system.

# Measurement of stair steps

    The project is created to calculate the time spent on each 
step when going up or down a building.
The calculation of step measurements for ascending stairs is 
to simulate an evacuation scenario, such as escaping
to higher ground to avoid a tsunami, in order to determine 
how much time is needed to escape and survive.
The calculation of step measurements for descending stairs is to 
simulate an evacuation scenario,
such as escaping from a building to avoid a fire, in order to determine 
how much time is needed to escape and survive.
